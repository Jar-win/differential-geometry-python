Mathematical Animations on Group Theory and Differential Geometry

Animations on Group Theory and Differential Geometry <br/>

Classification:<br/>
1. `arrow_group_props.py` : <b>Group Axioms (Animation)</b>
2. `group_arrow.py` : <b> Homomorphism , Isomorphism , Rotational Symmetry of Triangles (Animation)</b>
3. `housekeeping_axis3d.py` : <b> For Creating 3D axis in Vpython</b>
4. `surface_manim.py` : <b> Homeomorphism and Regular Surface Definition (Animation) </b> 

<br/>
2D animations are made using <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">manim</a>, (which uses aggdraw internally).<br/>
3D animations are made using <a href="http://www.glowscript.org/docs/VPythonDocs/index.html">Vpython</a>
